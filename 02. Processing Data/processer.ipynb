Possibly there cannot be a better relief to the wrecked lives of such women.\\n\\nHowever, there are women who are still outside its ambit and not eligible for maintenance, the women who have been cheated by such men and who are unwed mothers. I hope the day is not far away when the court will rule that the cheated unwed mothers too are eligible for maintenance.\\n\\nS. Rama Chandra Rao\\n\\nVisakhapatnam\\n\\nFarmers’ woes\\n\\nCyclone Phailin and the torrential rains that followed have devastated standing crops on thousands of hectares in Srikakulam district.\\n\\nThe plight of the farmers is heart-rending.\\n\\nIt is unfortunate that no political leader has expressed empathised with affected farmers.\\n\\nThe Congress-led UPA Government at the Centre has shown its callousness in pushing forward its agenda to divide the State while the common man is crying for relief from the natural calamity and some compensation for the colossal loss to the crops.\\n\\nA.V.L. Bhujanga Rao\\n\\nVisakhapatnam\\n\\nEpidemic threat\\n\\nThe action of GVMC Commissioner M.V. Satyanarayana in taking steps to prevent outbreak of contagious diseases after the rains go away is laudable. Contamination of water, breeding of mosquitoes and quick non-removal of trash are the main contributors to causing epidemics and they should be addressed first.
